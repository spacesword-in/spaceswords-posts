## AI-THE FUTURE

### What is AI?
 The future foundation so called "AI" is nothing but 
 "artificial intelligence" is getting upon the nerves of all the MNC like "Google","Amazon"," Facebook" ,"Deepmind","Fluid AI" etc.

  So  what is AI the so called Artificial Intelligence ? 
  
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". ... In general use, the term "artificial intelligence" means a machine which act like human.The computer can itself apply the skills to do a specific task.Let's see the examples where artificial intelligence is used in our day to day life.
  
 ##### AI in day to day life
 1.Google search engine:

   This includes deep neural networks, networks of hardware and software that approximate the web of neurons in the human brain. By analyzing vast amounts of digital data, these neural nets can learn all sorts of useful tasks, like identifying photos, recognizing commands spoken into a smartphone, and, as it turns out, responding to Internet search queries. In some cases, they can learn a task so well that they outperform humans. They can do it better. They can do it faster. And they can do it at a much larger scale.
   
   2.Voice assistants 
   
   The amazon's code alexa ,google's assistant ,samsung's bixby ,apples's siri and microsofts cortana they all uses AI.As they all have tendency to learn from the commands that you give them.See the video below by MKBHD that has the battle of all the assistants.

3.Video Games:

 Video Games
One of the instances of AI that most people are probably familiar with, video game AI has been used for a very long time—since the very first video games, in fact. But the complexity and effectiveness of that AI has increased exponentially over the past several decades, resulting in video game characters that learn your behaviors, respond to stimuli, and react in unpredictable ways. 2014’s Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is especially notable for the individual personalities given to each non-player character, their memories of past interaction, and their variable objectives.

First-person shooters like Far Cry and Call of Duty also make significant use of AI, with enemies that can analyze their environments to find objects or actions that might be beneficial to their survival; they’ll take cover, investigate sounds, use flanking maneuvers, and communicate with other AIs to increase their chances of victory. As far as AI goes, video games are somewhat simplistic, but because of the industry’s huge market, a great deal of effort and money are invested every year in perfecting this type of AI.

## AI AT ADVANCED LEVEL

1.Self driving cars:
There is a great competition amongst baidu and google for the self driving cars.

2.The sophia robot:

   This robot is also AI based and can give you some amazing answers.Recently this robot visited India.
 This robot is just amazing.
 Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015 and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States. She is able to display more than 62 facial expressions.  

Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews. While interviewers around the world have been impressed by the sophistication of many of Sophia's responses to their questions, the bulk of Sophia's meaningful statements are believed by experts to be somewhat scripted.But its not true.

#### AI AND MEDICINES -(By Paul Hsieh)

Paul Hsieh says:

Could a robot do my job as a radiologist?

If you asked me 10 years ago, I would have said, “No way!” But if you ask me today, my answer would be more hesitant, “Not yet — but perhaps someday soon.”

In particular, new “deep learning” artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are showing promise in performing medical work which until recently was thought only capable of being done by human physicians.

For example, deep learning algorithms have been able to diagnose the presence or absence of tuberculosis (TB) in chest x-ray images with astonishing accuracy. Researchers first “trained” the AIs with hundreds of x-ray images of patients without and with tuberculosis. Then, they tested the AIs with 150 new x-rays. The algorithms achieved an impressive 96% accuracy rate — better than many human radiologists — and the researchers believe they can improve upon this with more training cases and more advanced deep learning models. As the study authors note, “Automated detection of pulmonary TB at chest radiography may facilitate screening and evaluation efforts in TB-prevalent areas with limited access to radiologists.”

Similar deep learning algorithms have shown encouraging successes in other branches of medicine such as pathology, ophthalmology (eye diseases), and cardiology.

Researchers at Google were able to train an AI to detect spread of breast cancer into lymph node tissue on microscopic specimen images with accuracy comparable to (or greater than) human pathologists. Looking for tiny deposits of cancer on a specimen slide can be challenging — like trying to find a single unusually shaped house in a stack of satellite photographs of an entire city. But whereas a human pathologist might suffer from fatigue or inattention, the AI can process gigapixel images without breaking a sweat.


Similarly, neural networks have shown to be (slightly) better than human physicians at detecting changes of diabetes in images of patient’s retinas.

However, I’m most intrigued by the possibility of AIs detecting new associations not yet detected by humans. For instance, UK researchers gave data on 295,000 patients to machine learning algorithms, to allow them to correlate medical history with rates of heart attacks. Then the algorithms were given records from another 82,000 patients and asked to predict which ones would have heart attacks. (These were patients whose subsequent history of heart attacks were already known). The algorithms’ results were compared to the predictions based on current “best practice” American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, which includes patient age, smoking history, cholesterol levels, diabetes history, etc


#### Are employees in danger due to AI?
AI is the actual reason why jobs in America are disappearing.

Almost 100 years ago, the U.S. horse population peaked at about 26 million. There's been, of course, a steady decline since then, thanks to the growth of machines -- most notably, cars.
Today, a debate rages over workers and whether we too may become obsolete as society becomes automated.

The fear of robots replacing jobs is real -- consider self-checkout kiosks and self-driving trucks. The good news is that specific lines of work won't suffer the same fate as horses. 

But as it is said that:

Think about it,it can be equally dangerous.
