## Free of Cost
   Let's say you purchase a new computer at around INR30k. Then you go on to spend around another INR8k for Windows 10 Home (or INR15k for Pro). Even if it comes bundled with the computer, it's not really free - you've had to pay for it.
    On the other hand, Ubuntu (and most Linux distros) as free of cost. So, you can save that money legally (i.e without having to 'steal' the OS).
## Robust
I've never had to reinstall Ubuntu because it got 'corrupted'.    Also, you must be all too familiar with Blue Screen of Death which happens with most Windows users often. I've never faced it with Ubuntu.
   ## Secure
You don't have to worry about virus attacks or things like spyware or adware as they're all directed towards Windows users. Just install AdBlock Plus to turn off the ads (which is required on all OS anyway thanks to the amount of ads online).
   ## Ease of Use
Contrary to popular belief, Ubuntu (and few other popular distros like Fedora, Mint & Debian) is very easy to use. Personally, I find Windows as bit cumbersome now as with every iteration, they make just too many changes - even when they add no increase in functionality.\
Also, if you wish to do something like convert JPG to PDF, you can do it by typing 3 words instead of having to install a 20MB software.
## Size 
 The Ubuntu DVD is a mere 1GB. A clean install takes around 2.5-3GB on your HDD as compared to 20GB for Windows 7 (I haven't installed Win 8 or later on my own computer so can't say). Also, this 3GB includes the bundled office suite (LibreOffice)! So, if you to use Windows, you'd end up using 25GB of HDD for just the OS, office suite, PDF reader, a usable web-browser, a bit-torrent client, etc. All these things are packed with Ubuntu already. So, as soon as you install the OS, you're good to get down to work.
## Freedom
On Linux, the user is the most powerful person. If you were to use Windows, certain activities wouldn't be allowed. No so on Linux where you can do as you please - even if it means asking the OS to delete itself.\
Also, you get plenty of different ways to get your job done the way you like, thanks to the Terminal.
## Free & Open Source (FOSS)
It may or may not be an important thing for you. Being FOSS, it means that you're free to make any changes to the OS you like and distribute it (but not for profit). It also means that as there are many people contributing to the code, any malicious code gets caught and fixed - there is nobody like Microsoft spying on you.
   ## Customization
You can customize the entire OS as you wish. Don't like the windows manager? Get a new one! Don't like a bundled software? Purge it! Want to change some system code? Go ahead! No matter what you do, you would continue to be supported. So, it's great for both end-users & developers.
   ## Community
Ubuntu has a fairly large user-base. So, you can get easy & quick help from places like Ask Ubuntu or Ubuntu Forums.

> However, if you play lots of games, you might have to stick to Windows. There are lots of games available now, and you can play other popular ones thanks to Steam. Windows games can be run via Wine (but won't run the same). So, if you're a hard-core gamer, just see if the games you play are on Ubuntu yet.

**I will soon be posting on different linux distros and which to choose..**
