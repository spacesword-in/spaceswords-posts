In this post, I would like to talk about why you should learn to code and where to start.

# Introduction

In today's world when I see around, I see that almost every person irrespective of what they are, where they live, what they do are surrounded by some kind of technology. It may be your smartphone, a laptop, desktop, a smart watch, a smart tv running android on it, a smart home... and what not, the list is endless. Today almost every thing involves technology in one way or the other. Some of the best technologies that are growing exponentially now a days are:
* Internet of things (IoT)
* Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Robotics
* Augumented Reality
* Virtual Reality

and a lot more. 

This is just a couple of fields where the growth is tremendous. So, have you ever wondered how all these things work? How they make your life so much easier. I mean, today you can see things that nobody would have thought about in the past. So, how this all came.

Well, the answer to all this is, __Computer Programming__. In recent years, programming has become one of the hottest topics in the world. It used to be a thing of the highly qualified engineers, scientists, researchers in the past. But now, anyone can learn to code. Even if you don't know to write in English you can learn coding! 

# Why learn to code?

Some of the compelling reasons about why one should learn to code are: 

## Increase problem solving ability

In programming you have to solve problems that require you think out of the box. You have to develop solutions to the problems that no one have thought of before. It is a constantly growing industry and brings challanges to you almost on a daily basis. This helps you to dive deep into a problem and think differently to arrive at the solution.([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming))

## Easy to learn 

To some people it may look like completely foreign topic. They may find it difficult to learn to code. But trust me it is a child's play to learn to code. (Yes, I am Serious. [Learn more](https://www.simplilearn.com/young-app-developers-who-become-millionaires-article))

## Make more money

Today the Programming industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and also in India. People in India are becoming more skillful in technology. Jobs like Technical Writing, Web development, Android development, Data Science, Machine Learning Engineer, IoT Engineer are among the highest paying jobs. They require highly skilled people to make their user experience smooth.

These are some of the reasons, I can think of about why you should learn to code?

# Where can you start?


There are many sources which provide you free courses and tutorials on programming. Some of them are listed as under: 

[__Codeacademy__](https://www.codecademy.com/)

It provides a series of free tutorials on the basic web programming like HTML, CSS and some programming languages like Python, Ruby, etc.

[__FreeCodeCamp__](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

FreeCodeCamp is for those who want to learn to start out with web development. It is perfect for beginners as you start from HTML, CSS that require no prior programming experience.

[__Tutorials Point__](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm)

Tutorials Point provides tutorials on different topics for quickly getting an overview of the programming language, and various topics in programming. It provides a good reference to any of your query.

[__Udacity__](https://in.udacity.com/)

Udacity provides you a series of short video lectures on various topics starting from beginning to the advanced level. But most of its courses are paid, however you can access them individually as free courses.(I personally prefer it.)


[__Edx__](https://www.edx.org/)

Edx is an alternative to udacity, but it provides its courses for free to the geeks and learners.


[__Udemy__](https://www.udemy.com/)

Udemy is a paid site. But provides its lectures at very low cost.
